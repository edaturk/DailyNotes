SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles. Coined by Michael Feathers for the software design principles presented by Robert C. Martin in an essay titled “Design Principles and Design Patterns”, SOLID stands for five principles of object-oriented software design:

- Single Responsibility
- Open-Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

SOLID design principles can greatly improve the quality of software by guiding developers in achieving robust, modular, and flexible code that can adapt to changing requirements without major modifications.

**Single Responsibility:** Each class should have a single responsibility and should encapsulate that responsibility. 

**Open Closed Principle:** Originated from the work of Bertrand Meyer, a should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class without modifying its existing code.

**Liskov Substitution Principle:** Introduced by Barbara Liskov, it states that objects of a superclass should be replicable  with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. Derived class should be able to substitute its base class without causing any unexpected behavior. 

**Interface Segregation Principle:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It suggests creating smaller and more specific interfaces instead of a single large interface.

**Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

```
class Database { 
public: 
	void save(const std::string& data) { 
		// Save to database implementation 
	} 
}; 
class Logger { 
private: 
	Database& database; 
public: 
	Logger(Database& database) : database(database) {} 
	
	void log(const std::string& message) { 
		// Log message using the database 
		database.save(message); 
	} 
};
```
The problem lies in the `Logger` class, specifically in its constructor and member variable.
The member variable database is a reference to an instance of the Database class. This means that Logger class depends on a concrete implementation of the Database class.
High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

```
class DatabaseInterface { 
public: 
	virtual void save(const std::string& data) = 0; 
	virtual ~DatabaseInterface() {} 
}; 
class Database : public DatabaseInterface { 
public: 
	void save(const std::string& data) override { 
	// Save to database implementation 
	} 
}; 
class Logger { 
private: 
	DatabaseInterface& database; 
public: 
	Logger(DatabaseInterface& database) : database(database) {} 
	void log(const std::string& message) { 
	// Log message using the database database.save(message); 
	} 
};
```
