A compiler is a computer program that translates source code written in one programming language into a different language, usually machine code or assembly. 
It is essential to know that they work closely with the linker and the standard library. The linker takes care of combining compiled object files and libraries into a single executable, while the standard library provides implementations for common functionalities used in your code.

#### Stages of Compilation in C++
The process of compilation in C++ can be divided into four primary stages: Preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.

**Preprocessing:** Preprocessors modify the source code before the actual compilation process. They handle directives that start with `#` symbol like `#define` , `#include` , and `#if` . In this stage, included header files are expanded, macros are replaced , and conditional compilation statements are processed. 

**Compilation:** The compiler translates the modified source code into an intermediate representation, usually specific to the target processor architecture. This step also involves performing syntax checking, semantic analysis, and producing error messages for and issues encountered in the source code.

**Assembly:** This stage generates assembly code using mnemonics and syntax that is specific to the target processor architecture. Assemblers then convert this assembly code into object code.

**Linking:** The final stage is the linking of the object code with the necessary libraries and other object files. The linker merges multiple object files and libraries, resolves external references from other modules or libraries, allocates memory addresses for functions and variables, and generates an executable file that can be run on the target platform.
