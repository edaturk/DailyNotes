The memory model in C++ defines how the program stores and accesses data in computer memory. It consists of different segments, such as the Stack, Heap, Data and Code segments.
#### Stack Memory
Stack memory is used for automatic storage duration variables, such as local variables and function call data. Stack memory is managed by the compiler, and its allocation and deallocation are done automatically. The stack memory is also a LIFO data structure.

#### Heap Memory 
Heap memory is used for dynamic storage duration variables, such as objects created using the `new` keyword. The programmer has control over the allocation and deallocation of heap memory using `new` and `delete` operators. Heap memory is a larger pool of memory than  the stack, but has a slower access time.

#### Data Segment
The Data segment is composed of two parts: the initialized data segment and the uninitialized data segment. The initialized data segment stores global, static and constant variables with initial values, whereas the uninitialized segment stores uninitialized global and static variables.

#### Code Segment 
The Code segment also known as the text segment stores the executable code (machine code) of the program. It usually located in a read-only area of memory to prevent accidental modification.
